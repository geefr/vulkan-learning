06 - restructure
================

Functional blocks to be split into classes:

- Instance setup
  - device creation
  - queue creation
  - command pool creation

- The window/WSI integration bits/render target
  - swapchain creation
  - swapchain images
  
  - Requires instance/device

- framebuffers
  - Can't be in WSI stuff as the render pass needs to be setup in between
  - class taking references to wsi stuff and the render pass info I guess

- pipeline setup
  - render pass stuff included here for now?
  - basic to start with - just what we've got but better layout
  - needs extent of swapchain
  
- Overall registrar
  - Holds 1 or more of each of the others, and deals with init/destruction calls from application?
  - So basically splitting the existing registrar class down into separate bits

- Util
  - utility methods at the bottom of registrar
  - shader reading methods
  - Small functions for creating each type/doing the logic
  - debug callback/setup
  - Didl
